# Python Notes
To get the length of a string, use the len() function. Here 'a' is string
print(len(a))
To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in. It only answerd in yes and no.
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)
If not
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
  print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")
Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 
print(a[2:5])



# Python Code
Starting  
print("Starting of python programming.")

// TO USE MULTI LINE String == """"type string here for multi line i.e 3"""

'''Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.'''
if (5>2):
 print("5 is greater.")

#  You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
x=5
x="String"
print(type(x))

# If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. 
This is called unpacking

fruits=['apple','mangoes','orange']
a,b,c=fruits
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print("This is \"paper\"")  // It is use to write "" in run time
